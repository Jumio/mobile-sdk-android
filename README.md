#### Changes
* Optimized 3D liveness handling to reduce number of false rejects [Netverify]
* Improved reading of ePassports [Netverify]

#### Fixes
* Various smaller bug fixes/improvements [Netverify/Fastfill, Authentication, Document Verification, BAM Checkout]

# Basic Setup

## General Requirements
The requirements for the SDK are:
*	Android 4.4 (API level 19) or higher
*	ARMv7 processor with Neon, ARM64-v8a
*	Internet connection

## Permissions
Required permissions are linked automatically by the SDK.

The following permissions are optional:
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="false"/>
```

**Note:** On devices running Android Marshmallow (6.0) and above, you need to acquire `android.permissions.CAMERA` dynamically before initializing the SDK.

Use `getRequiredPermissions` to get a list of all required permissions.

```
public static String[] getRequiredPermissions();
```

## Proguard
If you are using Proguard, add the following lines in its configuration.

```
-keep class com.jumio.** { *; }
-keep class jumio.** { *; }
-keep class com.microblink.** { *; }
-keep class com.microblink.**$* { *; }
-dontwarn com.microblink.**
-keep class com.facetec.zoom.** { *; }
-dontwarn javax.annotation.Nullable
```

## Integration
Use the SDK in your application by including the Maven repositories with the following `build.gradle` configuration in Android Studio:

```
repositories {
	google()
	jcenter()
	maven { url 'https://mobile-sdk.jumio.com' }
}
```

Check the Android Studio sample projects to learn the most common use.

## Architecture
You can filter which architecture to use by specifying the abiFilters.

__Note:__ The abiFilters command in the ndk closure affects the Google Play Store filtering.

```
defaultConfig {
	ndk {
		abiFilters "armeabi-v7a","arm64-v8a","x86","x86_64"
	}
}
```

The apk can be split based on the architecture if multiple apks should be uploaded to the Google Play Store. Google Play Store manages to deliver the appropriate apk for the device.
```
splits {
	abi {
		enable true
		reset()
		include armeabi-v7a","arm64-v8a","x86","x86_64"
		universalApk false
	}
}
```

__Note:__ You get an *UnsatisfiedLinkError*, if the app and the CPU architecture do not match.

## Configuration

### Localizing labels
Our SDK supports the [default Android localization features](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/languages.html) for different languages and cultures.
All label texts and button titles in the SDK can be changed and localized by adding the required Strings you want to change in a `strings.xml` file in a `values` directory for the language and culture preference that you want to support. You can check out strings that are modifiable at [.../src/main/res/values/strings-jumio-sdk.xml](https://github.com/Jumio/mobile-sdk-android/blob/master/sample/JumioMobileSample/src/main/res/values/strings-jumio-sdk.xml) within our Sample application.

For our products Fastfill,Netverify & Document Verification we are providing six individual languages for your convenience:
* Chinese (Simplified)
* Dutch
* English
* French
* German
* Spanish

Our SDK supports accessibility features. Visually impaired users can now enable __TalkBack__ or change the __font size__ on their device. The accessibility-strings that are used by TalkBack contain *accessibility_* in their key and can be also modified in the `strings.xml`.
