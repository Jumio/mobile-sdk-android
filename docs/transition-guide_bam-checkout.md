#### Migrate to AndroidX
The support library was migrated to [`AndroidX`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/). As the developer page outlines, this is a mandatory step since all new Support Library development and maintenance will occur in the AndroidX library. This [`migration guide`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) shows you how to migrate your application to AndroidX.

Check out the changed dependencies in the  [`dependencies section`](https://github.com/Jumio/mobile-sdk-android/blob/master/docs/integration_id-verification-fastfill.md#dependencies) or in the [`build.gradle`](https://github.com/Jumio/mobile-sdk-android/blob/master/sample/JumioMobileSample/build.gradle) of the sample application.
The mapping for all support libraries is listed in section "Artifact mappings" [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate)

Dependencies that changed in the SDK:
+ com.android.support:appcompat-v7:27.1.1 -> androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.0.0
+ com.android.support:design:27.1.1 -> com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0
- com.android.support:support-v4:27.1.1 -> androidx.legacy:legacy-support-v4:1.0.0 (was merged by AndroidX and can be therefore be fully removed)

## 2.13.0
#### Removed Deprecated ABIs mips, mips64 and armeabi
These ABIs were deprecated in recent NDK toolsets as mentioned here - https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis and are not used any more.
