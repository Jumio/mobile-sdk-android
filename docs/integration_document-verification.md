# Document Verification SDK for Android
Document Verification is a powerful solution to enable scanning various types (Utility Bill, Bank statement and many others) of your customer's documents in your mobile application within seconds, also supporting data extraction on documents like Utility Bills and Bank Statements (see [Supported documents for data extraction](https://github.com/Jumio/implementation-guides/blob/master/netverify/document-verification.md#supported-documents))

## Release Notes
Please refer to our [Change Log](changelog.md) for more information. Current SDK version: 3.9.2

For breaking technical changes, please read our [transition guide](transition-guide_document-verification.md)

## Setup
The [basic setup](../README.md#basics) is required before continuing with the following setup for DocumentVerification.

Using the SDK requires an activity declaration in your AndroidManifest.xml.

```
<activity
  android:name="com.jumio.dv.DocumentVerificationActivity"
	android:theme="@style/Theme.DocumentVerification"
	android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
	android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|keyboardHidden"/>
```

You can specify your own theme (see [Customization](#customizing-look-and-feel) chapter). The orientation can be sensor based or locked with the attribute `android:screenOrientation`.


## Dependencies
Below there is a list of dependices the application will need to work in Android. Some modules are mandatory, others are optinal. If an optional module is __not linked__, some functionalities such as certain methods may not be available, but the library size will be reduced. The [Sample app](../sample/JumioMobileSample/) apk size with the products ID Verification, BAM, Document Verification and Authentication included is currently around __18 MB__.

```
dependencies {
    // mandatory
    implementation "com.jumio.android:core:3.9.2@aar"   // Jumio core library
    implementation "com.jumio.android:dv:3.9.2@aar"     // Document verification library

    implementation "androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0"
    implementation "androidx.room:room-runtime:2.2.6"

    implementation "com.google.android.material:material:1.2.1"
}
```
__Note:__ Version numbers may vary.

#### Root Detection
Applications implementing the SDK shall not run on rooted devices. Use either the below method or a self-devised check to prevent usage of SDK scanning functionality on rooted devices.
```
DocumentVerificationSDK.isRooted(Context context);
```

#### Device Supported Check
Call the method `isSupportedPlatform` to check if the device is supported.
```
DocumentVerificationSDK.isSupportedPlatform();
```

Check the Android Studio [sample app](../sample/JumioMobileSample/) to learn the most common use.

## Initialization
Log into your Jumio customer portal. You can find your customer API token and API secret on the __Settings__ page under __API credentials__ tab. To create an instance for the SDK, perform the following call as soon as your activity is initialized.

```
private static String YOURAPITOKEN = ""; 
private static String YOURAPISECRET = "";

DocumentVerificationSDK documentVerificationSDK = DocumentVerificationSDK.create(yourActivity, YOURAPITOKEN, YOURAPISECRET, JumioDataCenter.US);
```
Make sure that your customer API token and API secret are correct, specify an instance
of your activity and provide a reference to identify the scans in your reports (max. 100 characters or `null`). If your customer account is in the EU data center, use `JumioDataCenter.EU` instead. Alternatively, use `JumioDataCenter.SG` for Singapore.

__Note:__ We strongly recommend storing all credentials outside of your app!

## Configuration

### Document Type
Use `setType()` to pass the document type.
```
documentVerificationSDK.setType("DOCUMENTTYPE");
```

Possible types:

*  BC (Birth certificate)
*  BS (Bank statement)
*  CAAP (Cash advance application)
*  CB (Council bill)
*  CC (Credit card)
*  CCS (Credit card statement)
*  CRC (Corporate resolution certificate)
*  HCC (Health care card)

*  TR (Tax return)
*  UB (Utility bill)
*  VC (Voided check)
*  VT (Vehicle title)
*  WWCC (Working with children check)
*  CUSTOM (Custom document type)

#### Custom Document Type
Use the following method to pass your custom document code. Maintain your custom document code within your Jumio customer portal under the tab __Settings__ --> __Document Verification__ --> __Custom__.
```
documentVerificationSDK.setCustomDocumentCode("YOURCUSTOMDOCUMENTCODE");
```

### Country Selection
You can specify issuing country  using [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) country codes. In the example down below the United States ("USA") have been preselected. Use "XKX" for Kosovo.
```
documentVerificationSDK.setCountry("USA");
```

### Transaction Identifiers
Use the following property to identify the scan in your reports (max. 100 characters).
```
documentVerificationSDK.setReportingCriteria("YOURREPORTINGCRITERIA");
```

Use the following property to identify the scan in your reports (max. 100 characters).
```
documentVerificationSDK.setCustomerInternalReference("YOURSCANREFERENCE");
```

You can also set a user reference (max. 100 characters).
```
documentVerificationSDK.setUserReference("USERREFERENCE");
```

__Note:__ Transaction identifiers must not contain sensitive data like PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or account login.

### Callback
A callback URL can be specified for individual transactions constraints see chapter [Callback URL](#callback-url). This setting overrides your Jumio customer settings.
```
documentVerificationSDK.setCallbackUrl("YOURCALLBACKURL");
```
__Note:__ The callback URL must not contain sensitive data like PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or account login.


### Data Extraction
Data extraction is automatically enabled when it is activated for your account. Use the following setting to disable the extraction on a transaction level:

```
documentVerificationSDK.setEnableExtraction(false);
```

__Note:__ If you would like to enable extraction for your account in general, please contact your Account Manager, or reach out to Jumio Support at support@jumio.com or [online](https://support.jumio.com).

### Camera Handling
Use setCameraPosition to configure the default camera (front or back).
```
documentVerificationSDK.setCameraPosition(JumioCameraPosition.FRONT);
```

Use setDocumentName to override the document label on Help screen.
```
documentVerificationSDK.setDocumentName(“YOURDOCNAME”);
```

## Customization

### Customize Look and Feel
The SDK can be customized to fit your application’s look and feel by specifying `Theme.DocumentVerification` as a parent style of your own custom theme. Click on the element `Theme.DocumentVerification` in the manifest while holding Ctrl and Android Studio will display the available items. Change the colors of the styles attributes to fit your requirements.

There are two possibilities for applying the customized theme that was explained in the previous chapter:
* Customizing theme in AndroidManifest
* Customizing theme at runtime

#### Customizing Theme in AndroidManifest
Apply  the '`CustomDocumentVerificationTheme` that you defined before by replacing `Theme.DocumentVerification` in the AndroidManifest.xml:
```
<activity
            android:name="com.jumio.dv.DocumentVerificationActivity"
            android:theme="@style/CustomDocumentVerificationTheme"
						... />
```

### Customizing Theme at Runtime
To customize the theme at runtime, overwrite the theme that is used for Document Verification in the manifest by adding the line of code below. Use the resource id of a customized theme that uses `Theme.DocumentVerification` as parent.
```
documentVerificationSDK.setCustomTheme(CUSTOMTHEME);
```

## SDK Workflow

### Starting the SDK
To show the SDK, call the respective method below within your activity or fragment.

Activity: `DocumentVerificationSDK.start();`
Fragment: `startActivityForResult(documentVerificationSDK.getIntent(),DocumentVerificationSDK.REQUEST_CODE);`

__Note:__ The default request code is 300. To use another code, override the public static variable `DocumentVerificationSDK.REQUEST_CODE` before displaying the SDK.

### Retrieving Information
Implement the standard `onActivityResult()` method in your activity or fragment for successful scans (`Activity.RESULT_OK`) and user cancellation notifications (`Activity.RESULT_CANCELED`). Call `documentVerificationSDK.destroy()` once you received the result.

```
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
	if (requestCode == DocumentVerificationSDK.REQUEST_CODE) {
		if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
			// OBTAIN PARAMETERS HERE
			// YOURCODE
		} else if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_CANCELED) {
			String scanReference = data.getStringExtra(DocumentVerificationSDK.EXTRA_SCAN_REFERENCE);
			String errorMessage = data.getStringExtra(DocumentVerificationSDK.EXTRA_ERROR_MESSAGE);
			String errorCode = data.getStringExtra(DocumentVerificationSDK.EXTRA_ERROR_CODE);
			// YOURCODE
		}
        // CLEANUP THE SDK AFTER RECEIVING THE RESULT
         if (documentVerificationSDK != null) {
           documentVerificationSDK.destroy();
           documentVerificationSDK = null;
         }
	}
}
```

#### Error Codes
List of all **_error codes_** that are available via the `code` property of the DocumentVerificationError object. The first letter (A-K) represents the error case. The remaining characters are represented by numbers that contain information helping us understand the problem situation([x][yyyy]).

|Code        			| Message   | Description    |
